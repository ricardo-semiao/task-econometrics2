# Tasks: Time Series Econometrics

This repository contains tasks related to my Masters in Economics' class "Econometrics II". The tasks focus on time series models and simulations.

Each problem set has its own folder: [ps1](ps1/), [ps2](ps2/), [ps3](ps3/), [ps3](ps3/), [ps3](ps3/), [ps3](ps3/). Their structure is as follows:

- A _psi\_instructions.pdf_ file, with the questions of the P.S.
- A _psi.R_ and _psi.tex_ files, to generate the results and the final report, _psi.pdf_.
- A _data_, _figures_, and _tables_ folders, with assets.
- A _latex\_build_ folder, with auxiliary files for the .tex file compilation.
